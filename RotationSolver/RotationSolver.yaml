description: |-
  Based on the pve combat information in one frame, find the best action.

  The `information` is almost all the information available in one frame in combat, including the status of the all players in party, the status of the hostile targets, action cooling, the number of action stack, the MP and HP of charactors, the location of charactors, casting action of the hostile target, combo ID, combat duration, etc.

  So it is designed for `general combat`, not for savage or ultimate. So use it carefully.

  It will highlight the best action one the hotbar, or help you to click on it.
punchline: Based on the pve combat information in one frame, find the best action.
