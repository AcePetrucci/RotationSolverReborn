# Basic Settings

It is always good to know or control the `Rotation Solver`. So there are several tips for you.

## Repose

First of all, put a `Repose` Action to your hot bar which is shared. Rotation Solver will automatically replace `Repose` to what it want to use. It is like [XIV Combo](https://github.com/attickdoor/XivComboPlugin). And yes, it is XIVCombo that inspired me to create Rotation Solver.

## Macros

Click on the button on the `Help` is not efficiency. So you can right click on the button to copy the macro to your clipboard. And add a macro with this command or use [QolBar](https://github.com/UnknownX7/QoLBar).

There is a brief macro function description.
